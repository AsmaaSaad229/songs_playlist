Using std::list

I created a menu driven application that
will simulate a user playing songs from a playlist of songs.

We will use a list to simulate the user selecting the the first song in the playlist and
then selecting next and previous to play forward of backwards through the 
playlist.


We will also allow users to add new song to the playlist and they
will be added prior to the currently playing song.
